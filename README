NAME
    Rubic - Remote admin tool for ubic

VERSION
    0.0801

DESCRIPTION
    The distribution contains a web server "rubic" which allow you to run
    Ubic commands using a REST API. It also has a HTML based web interface
    or easy administration for humans.

    This is Ubic::Ping::Service on steroids.

    See also Mojolicious::Plugin::Ubic.

SYNOPSIS
      $ rubic daemon --listen http://*:5000

    Look for "Base path" in the output. Example:

      [Sun Nov 17 13:45:06 2013] [info] Base path: /e3927cec591094d8294dfff30f1110f3

    Point your browser at
    "http://localhost:5000/e3927cec591094d8294dfff30f1110f3"

  Environment variables
    *   UBIC_BASE_PATH

        Set your own "Base path" instead of using the auto-generated. This
        should be something very long to make it "impossible" to brute
        force.

    *   MOJO_CONFIG

        Possible to configure the application using a config file in Perl
        format.

FAQ
    What is ubic?
        See Ubic::Manual::FAQ.

    Why this weird "Base path"?
        Just to make it a bit safer, without requiring user/password. It is
        possible to make it safer by mouting the plugin in your own
        Mojolicious application, where you can add any sort of
        authentication you want.

    What about SSL support?
        It should be supported out of the box if you install
        IO::Socket::SSL:

          $ rubic daemon --listen https://*:5000

        See "listen" in Mojo::Server::Daemon for more inforation about the
        "--listen" argument.
